        "    Pac-Man is a classic arcade game where the player controls a character, Pac-Man, through a maze. The objective is to eat all the pellets in the maze while avoiding four ghosts that pursue Pac-Man. If Pac-Man eats a large power pellet, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for extra points.\n",
        "    The game is over when Pac-Man is caught by a ghost or when the player runs out of lives.\n",
        "    Core Game Elements:\n",
        "\n",
        "        Maze Layout:\n",
        "            The game is set within a grid-like maze. The walls are solid, and Pac-Man cannot pass through them.\n",
        "            The maze contains corridors where Pac-Man can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. Some sections of the maze loop back on themselves.\n",
        "            The maze contains two types of special tiles:\n",
        "                Pellets: Small dots scattered throughout the maze, worth 10 points each.\n",
        "                Power Pellets: Larger dots placed in the four corners of the maze, worth 50 points each. Eating a Power Pellet allows Pac-Man to eat the ghosts for a limited time.\n",
        "\n",
        "        Player Controls:\n",
        "            The player controls Pac-Man's movement using arrow keys (or other directional inputs, such as WASD).\n",
        "            Pac-Man moves continuously in the chosen direction until blocked by a wall or until the player changes direction.\n",
        "            Pac-Man cannot stop moving, so the player must carefully time movements and changes in direction.\n",
        "\n",
        "        Pac-Man Mechanics:\n",
        "            Movement: Pac-Man moves one tile at a time in a grid-based movement system.\n",
        "            Collision Detection: Pac-Man collides with walls, pellets, power pellets, and ghosts. Pac-Man cannot pass through walls.\n",

        "            Power Pellet Effects: Eating a Power Pellet allows Pac-Man to turn the ghosts blue for a short period (usually 7-10 seconds). During this time, Pac-Man can eat the ghosts for extra points. Ghosts revert to their regular form after the time limit.\n",

        "                Inky (Cyan Ghost): Has a more complex behavior, targeting an area between Pac-Man and Blinky's current location.\n",
        "                Clyde (Orange Ghost): Alternates between chasing Pac-Man and wandering randomly when he gets too close to Pac-Man.\n",
        "            Ghost Movement: Ghosts move one tile at a time, just like Pac-Man, and they can change directions at intersections. Their goal is to catch Pac-Man.\n",
        "            Ghost States:\n",
        "                Chase Mode: Ghosts actively pursue Pac-Man based on their unique behavior patterns.\n",

        "                Frightened Mode: After Pac-Man eats a Power Pellet, ghosts turn blue and flee from Pac-Man. In this mode, Pac-Man can eat them for extra points. When a ghost is eaten, it respawns at the center of the maze and resumes chasing Pac-Man.\n",

            "    Pac-Man is a classic arcade game where the player controls a character, Pac-Man, through a maze. The objective is to eat all the pellets in the maze while avoiding four ghosts that pursue Pac-Man. If Pac-Man eats a large power pellet, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for extra points. \n",

            "            The game is set within a grid-like maze. The walls are solid, and Pac-Man cannot pass through them.\n",
            "            The maze contains corridors where Pac-Man can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. Some sections of the maze loop back on themselves.\n",
            "            The maze contains two types of special tiles:\n",
            "                Pellets: Small dots scattered throughout the maze, worth 10 points each.\n",
            "                Power Pellets: Larger dots placed in the four corners of the maze, worth 50 points each. Eating a Power Pellet allows Pac-Man to eat the ghosts for a limited time.\n",

            "        Player Controls:\n",
            "            The player controls Pac-Man's movement using arrow keys (or other directional inputs, such as WASD).\n",
            "            Pac-Man moves continuously in the chosen direction until blocked by a wall or until the player changes direction.\n",
            "            Pac-Man cannot stop moving, so the player must carefully time movements and changes in direction.\n",

            "        Pac-Man Mechanics:\n",

            "            Power Pellet Effects: Eating a Power Pellet allows Pac-Man to turn the ghosts blue for a short period (usually 7-10 seconds). During this time, Pac-Man can eat the ghosts for extra points. Ghosts revert to their regular form after the time limit.\n",

            "            Ghost Movement: Ghosts move one tile at a time, just like Pac-Man, and they can change directions at intersections. Their goal is to catch Pac-Man.\n",

            "    Pac-Man is a classic arcade game where the player controls a character, Pac-Man, through a maze. The objective is to eat all the pellets in the maze while avoiding four ghosts that pursue Pac-Man. If Pac-Man eats a large power pellet, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for extra points. \n",

            "                Power Pellets: Larger dots placed in the four corners of the maze, worth 50 points each. Eating a Power Pellet allows Pac-Man to eat the ghosts for a limited time.\n",

However, the following features are missing and need to be added:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Pellet Handling:**  The maze should contain pellets (small dots) and power pellets (large dots) that Pac-Man can collect.  Pellets should disappear when eaten, and the score should be updated accordingly.  Power pellets should activate a 'power-up' mode for Pac-Man.\\\\n2. **Power Pellet Functionality:** When Pac-Man eats a power pellet, the ghosts should change state to 'frightened' for a limited time (e.g., 7-10 seconds). During this time, Pac-Man can eat the ghosts for bonus points. After the time limit, the ghosts return to their normal state.\\\\n3. **Comprehensive Collision Detection:** Implement collision detection between Pac-Man and the ghosts. If Pac-Man collides with a ghost in normal mode, he loses a life. If Pac-Man collides with a ghost in frightened mode, he eats the ghost and gets points.\\\\n4. **Scoring System:** A scoring system should be implemented to track the player's score. Points are awarded for eating pellets (10 points each), power pellets (50 points each), and ghosts (200, 400, 800, 1600 points depending on the ghost).  Consider displaying the score on the screen.\\\\n5. **Lives and Game Over:** The player should start with 3 lives.  When Pac-Man collides with a ghost in normal mode, he loses a life. When all lives are lost, the game should end and display a 'Game Over' screen with the final score.\\\\n6. **Ghost AI (Pathfinding):** Implement basic AI for the ghosts.  Each ghost should have a different behavior (e.g., Blinky chases directly, Pinky ambushes, etc.).  Consider using a simple pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A* or a simplified greedy approach) to guide the ghost's movement towards Pac-Man.  Ghosts should avoid walls.\\\\n7. **Warp Tunnels:**  Implement warp tunnels on the left and right edges of the maze. When Pac-Man or a ghost enters one tunnel, it should reappear on the other side.\\\\n\\\\nThe current `maze` list represents the maze layout (0: empty, 1: wall).  You'll need to add pellet and power pellet positions to the game data.  Consider using additional lists or data structures to represent these.  Use Pygame to display pellets and power pellets on the screen. The existing code uses Pygame for drawing and event handling. Ensure the added features integrate smoothly with the existing code.  Consider adding functions for clarity and organization.  Remember to handle the game state (e.g.,  Pac-Man's lives, score, ghost states).\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"str\\\"}, \\\"coworker\\\": {\\\"description\\\": \\\"Senior Software Engineer\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"str\\\"}}\"\u001b[00m\n",

The objective is to eat all the pellets in the maze while avoiding four ghosts that pursue Pac-Man. If Pac-Man eats a large power pellet, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for extra points. \n",

            "            The maze contains corridors where Pac-Man can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. Some sections of the maze loop back on themselves.\n",

            "                Power Pellets: Larger dots placed in the four corners of the maze, worth 50 points each. Eating a Power Pellet allows Pac-Man to eat the ghosts for a limited time.\n",
